Warning (php-indent): Indentation fails badly with mixed HTML/PHP in the HTML part in
plain `php-mode'.  To get indentation to work you must use an
Emacs library that supports 'multiple major modes' in a buffer.
Parts of the buffer will then be in `php-mode' and parts in for
example `html-mode'.  Known such libraries are:
	mumamo, mmm-mode, multi-mode, web-mode
You do not have any of those in your `load-path'.
